;;; Commentary:

;; This is an Emacs binding for tree-sitter, an incremental parsing system
;; (https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). It includes both the core APIs, and a minor mode
;; that provides a buffer-local up-to-date syntax tree.

;;; TODO XXX: The doc says that `after-change-functions' can be called multiple times, with
;;; different regions enclosed in the region passed to `before-change-functions'. Therefore what we
;;; are doing may be a bit too naive. Several questions to investigate:
;;;
;;; 1. Are the *after* regions recorded all at once, or one after another? Are they disjointed
;;; (would imply the former)?.
;;;
;;; 2. Are the *after* regions recorded at the same time as the *before* region? If not, how can the
;;; latter possibly enclose the former, e.g. in case of inserting a bunch of text?
;;;
;;; 3. How do we batch *after* hooks to re-parse only once? Maybe using `run-with-idle-timer' with
;;; 0-second timeout?
;;;
;;; 4. What's the deal with several primitives calling `after-change-functions' *zero* or more
;;; times? Does that mean we can't rely on this hook at all?
